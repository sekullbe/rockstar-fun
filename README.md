lavalamp - Rockstar implementation of a code golf challenge:

Because Rockstar has no random function right now, I had to hardcode
the initial random values. This is actually pretty nice for writing
idiomatic Rockstar because I can make interesting lyrics with whatever
words are pleasing. :)

Also see https://github.com/sekullbe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/rockstar where I did
one of the AoC puzzles in Rockstar.
